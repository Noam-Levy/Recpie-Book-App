# Recpie-Book-App
Recipe book application mock-up.
The application manages user's favorite recipes list interactively and allows for new recipe searches against its data base or against an online repository (Spoonacular API).
each user has also the option to add new recipe to the application database.

The application has been created by Amit Maudi (https://github.com/amitm144) and I as an OOD college course assignment, to which we've added integration with Spoonacular api and MySQL DB.
